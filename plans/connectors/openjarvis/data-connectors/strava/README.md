# Strava

**Kind:** data connector (read-first) · **Auth:** oauth (refresh token) · **Platform:** Any · **Risk tier:** R1 · **Priority:** Later
**Reference implementation:** [`src/openjarvis/connectors/strava.py`](https://github.com/open-jarvis/OpenJarvis/blob/main/src/openjarvis/connectors/strava.py) in OpenJarvis (Apache-2.0)

## What it gives JARVIS
Recent activities (runs, rides) for fitness summaries.

## How a user connects it
1. Create an API application at strava.com/settings/api.
2. Authorise it and obtain the refresh token.
3. In JARVIS: Settings → Connectors → Strava → enter Client ID, Secret and approve.

Credentials stay on the user's machine. In JARVIS they go to the OS keychain (plan 39), never to plain JSON or the relay (plan 41).

## How we implement it in JARVIS
1. **Adapter:** `bridge/connectors/strava.mjs` implementing the connector interface from [the connector framework](../../../README.md#the-jarvis-connector-interface): `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `status()`, `sync({ since, cursor })` yielding `Document` records, optional `search()` and `tools()`.
2. **Auth:** OAuth with PKCE/loopback redirect and refresh-token handling; scopes requested per capability, read-only first.
3. **Documents:** map to the shared `Document`/`MemoryItem` shapes (plan 38): stable `doc_id`, `source`, `doc_type`, `timestamp`, `participants`, `sensitivity`.
4. **Sync:** incremental by cursor/`since`, backoff on rate limits, scheduled by the event bus (plan 12), manual "Sync now" in Settings.
5. **Policy:** register the connector and each capability with a risk tier (R1); reads are allowed by default for the owner, writes (if any) are separate and approval-gated (plan 15). Everything fetched is **untrusted data** for prompt-injection purposes (plan 08).
6. **Index:** chunk and embed locally (plans 07, 33); answers cite source and date.
7. **Settings:** a card in Settings → Connectors (plan 39) with status dot, last sync, scopes, disconnect and "erase synced data".
8. **Health:** token-expiry detection and plain-language fix-it messages.

### Alternatives to compare before building
- Health data: store locally, summaries only to cloud models (plan 32). Check Strava's current API terms for AI use.

Option B: run OpenJarvis as a sidecar and call its connector (`jarvis connect strava`) through its API instead of re-implementing it; see [../../README.md](../../README.md#how-jarvis-can-use-openjarvis).

## Acceptance tests
- Connect with valid credentials, sync a fixture account, see documents with correct ids and timestamps.
- Wrong or revoked credentials produce a clear error, no crash, no stored garbage.
- Incremental sync returns only new items; rate-limit responses back off.
- Disconnect deletes credentials and (optionally) synced data.
- Prompt-injection fixture in the content cannot trigger an action.
- Nothing from this connector reaches a cloud model unless the user's privacy setting allows it for this source.
